# Iterative Development Plan

This document outlines the three planned iterations for developing the authentication API. Each iteration represents a complete and functional system that satisfies the baseline requirements, while adding new layers of security and robustness.

---

## Iteration 1 — Minimal Functional System (MVP)
**Goal:** Deliver a working authentication API that meets the fundamental functional requirements.

- Implement user registration with unique username enforcement.
- Implement user authentication (login) with success/failure responses.
- Store user credentials securely (hashed passwords) in Redis.
- Provide JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Redis data model for storing user accounts and sessions.
- Unit tests for registration, login, and basic error cases.
- Documentation of setup and usage in the README.

---

## Iteration 2 — Security and Robustness
**Goal:** Strengthen the system against misuse and prepare it to pass a basic security audit.

- Enforce password complexity requirements.
- Add input validation for usernames and passwords.
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts.
- Add session or token expiration handling.
- Introduce audit logging for registration and login attempts.
- Unit tests for password validation, rate limiting, and audit events.

---

## Iteration 3 — Production Readiness and Extensibility
**Goal:** Improve production quality and prepare for future extensions.

- Support logout and token/session revocation.
- Token revocation or blacklist mechanism stored in Redis.
- More comprehensive error handling and structured logging.
- Project-level improvements:
  - Containerization with Redis.
  - Linting, testing, and coverage.
- Annotate security gaps and future work.
- Unit tests for logout, revocation, and error handling flows.
