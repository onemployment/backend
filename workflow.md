## Project Overview

This project is a Node.js TypeScript API server that implements a user authentication service with Redis-based data persistence. The application provides a RESTful API with user registration and login endpoints. Built with Express.js framework and utilizing Redis for data storage, the project implements security measures including password hashing with bcrypt, input validation with Zod schemas, error handling with structured logging via Pino, and security middleware including Helmet and CORS protection. The application is containerized with Docker and includes a development workflow with automated testing, linting, formatting, and continuous integration via GitHub Actions.

## Architecture and Design Principles

The project follows clean architecture patterns and established design principles to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

### SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component has a single, well-defined purpose. Controllers handle HTTP request/response cycles, services contain business logic, and repositories manage data persistence. This separation ensures changes to one concern don't affect others.

**Open/Closed Principle**
The system uses interfaces and abstractions to allow extension without modification. Password hashing employs a strategy pattern where new algorithms can be added by implementing the password strategy interface without changing existing code.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
Interface-based design ensures any implementation can replace another without breaking functionality. Repository and service interfaces allow for seamless swapping of implementations during testing or when changing data storage solutions.

**Interface Segregation Principle**
Small, focused interfaces prevent classes from depending on methods they don't use. Separate interfaces exist for authentication, password operations, and data access, each containing only relevant methods.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Dependencies are injected through constructors, allowing for flexible configuration and improved testability.

### Node.js TypeScript Best Practices

**Type Safety and Validation**
Strict TypeScript configuration ensures compile-time type checking, while Zod schemas provide runtime validation for external data. This dual approach catches errors early and validates data at system boundaries.

**Error Handling**
Centralized error handling uses custom HTTP error classes with appropriate status codes. Async operations are wrapped in error handlers that properly propagate exceptions to the middleware layer.

**Security Implementation**
Security measures include input sanitization, secure password hashing with configurable rounds, structured logging that excludes sensitive data, and protective HTTP headers through middleware.

**Asynchronous Operations**
Consistent async/await patterns handle all asynchronous operations with proper error propagation. Middleware wrappers ensure unhandled promise rejections are caught and processed appropriately.

**Dependency Management**
Constructor-based dependency injection creates loose coupling between components, enabling easier testing through mock injection and flexible system configuration.

## AI Tools Usage

This project utilized AI-powered development tools to enhance code quality, accelerate development, and maintain architectural consistency.

### Primary AI Development Tools

**Claude Code** served as the primary development assistant for code generation, error debugging, system architecture design, and development planning. The tool facilitated git operations, internet research for documentation and best practices, and guidance on package selection and framework implementation.

**OpenAI Codex** was used as a secondary validation tool to cross-examine solutions and compare outputs from multiple language models.

### Structured Prompt Engineering Framework

AI interactions followed a structured prompt template for consistent outcomes:

• **Context**: Detailed description of the current project state and specific domain knowledge relevant to the task at hand

• **Task**: Explicit definition of the required action with clear boundaries defining what must be accomplished without scope creep

• **Expectation**: Precise specification of the expected deliverable format, whether code snippets, documentation, implementation plans, or architectural decisions

• **Validation**: Clear definition of success criteria and verification steps the AI agent must complete to confirm task completion

### Iterative Development Methodology

The AI-assisted development process followed an iterative approach with strict quality gates:

• **Isolated Task Execution**: Each AI interaction focused on small, well-defined, end-to-end tasks to maintain manageable context and ensure accuracy

• **Continuous Validation**: Every task completion was followed by running the full validation pipeline including build processes, unit tests, and integration tests

• **Risk Mitigation**: Application requirements and functionality were validated after each iteration to prevent regression and ensure system integrity

• **Context Management**: Each iteration maintained minimal and focused context to optimize AI agent performance and reduce potential for errors

This methodology ensured AI assistance maintained code quality while preserving control over development decisions.
