## Layer-by-Layer Analysis

### 1. Application Bootstrap & Entry Point

**Files Reviewed:**

- `src/index.ts` - Application bootstrap and lifecycle management
- `src/server.ts` - Express application factory

#### Strong Points:

✅ **Excellent Dependency Injection**: Clean composition root pattern with manual DI
✅ **Proper Lifecycle Management**: Graceful shutdown with Redis cleanup
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive uncaught exception and rejection handlers
